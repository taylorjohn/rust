# Analyzing Interview Questions

This guide will help you identify common patterns and algorithms in coding interview questions. By recognizing these patterns, you can quickly determine the most appropriate approach to solve the problem.

## General Approach

1. **Read carefully**: Pay attention to key words and constraints.
2. **Identify the data structures** mentioned or implied in the question.
3. **Look for hints** in the problem statement that suggest a specific algorithm.
4. **Consider the input size** to estimate the required time complexity.
5. **Think about edge cases** and potential pitfalls.

## Common Patterns to Look For

- **Iteration**: Problems that require going through elements one by one.
- **Two Pointers**: Often used for array or string problems.
- **Sliding Window**: Useful for contiguous sequence problems.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Look for problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization problems with overlapping subproblems.
- **Graph Traversal**: Problems involving connections or paths between entities.
- **Tree Traversal**: Questions about hierarchical structures.
- **Backtracking**: Combinatorial problems or puzzles.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Optimization problems where local optimal choices lead to global optimal solution.
- **Heap/Priority Queue**: Problems involving the 'k-th' element or maintaining a sorted subset.

Remember, practice is key to recognizing these patterns quickly. As you solve more problems, you'll become better at identifying the underlying algorithms and data structures needed.
