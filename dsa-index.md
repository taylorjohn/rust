# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust

This collection provides implementations and explanations of several advanced data structures and algorithms in Rust. Each structure is presented with its implementation, key concepts, and use cases.

## Table of Contents

1. [AVL Tree](avl_tree.md)
2. [Red-Black Tree](red_black_tree.md)
3. [B-Tree](b_tree.md)
4. [Trie (Prefix Tree)](trie.md)

Each data structure is implemented with a focus on Rust's safety features and idiomatic code. The implementations include basic operations like insertion, deletion (where applicable), and search.

## Choosing the Right Data Structure

When deciding which data structure to use, consider the following factors:

- The types of operations you need to perform (e.g., insertions, deletions, searches)
- The expected size of your data set
- The nature of your data (e.g., strings, numbers)
- The space constraints of your application
- The need for ordered data

Here's a quick guide on when to use each structure:

- **AVL Tree**: Use when you need a strictly balanced tree with faster lookups than Red-Black trees, but can tolerate slightly slower insertions and deletions.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Use when you need a balanced tree with faster insertions and deletions than AVL trees, and can tolerate slightly slower lookups.
- **B-Tree**: Use when working with large datasets that don't fit in memory, such as in database systems or file systems.
- **Trie**: Use for efficient prefix-based operations on strings, such as in autocomplete systems, spell checkers, or IP routing tables.
